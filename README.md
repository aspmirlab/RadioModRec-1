# RadioModRec-1
<p>RadioModRec-1 is an Automatic Modulation Recognition (AMR) simulated dataset carefully curated for fifteen digital modulation schemes consisting of 4QAM, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM, 8PSK, 16PSK, 32PSK, 64PSK, 128PSK, 256PSK, CPFSK, DBPSK, DQPSK, GFSK, and GMSK whose usefulness is predominantly found in modern wireless communication systems. 
<p>RadioModRec-1 dataset caters for the Rayleigh and the Rician channel models under the Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) from -20dB to +20dB at a step of +5dB. 
<p>The research that led to the RadioModRec-1 Dataset was supported by the Google Award to Prof E. Adetiba for TensorFlow Outreach in Colleges.
